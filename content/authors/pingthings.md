bio: PingThings partners with forward thinking utilities to take advantage of a structural shift to artificial intelligence in the energy industry driven by the grid's growing complexity. PingThings solves these issues with the PredictiveGrid™, a purpose built platform for ingesting, storing, accessing, visualizing, analyzing, and training machine- and deep-learning models with data from large numbers of sensors. The platform is offered as an on-premise appliance, and in either a public or private cloud. Benchmarks indicate that we are at least two orders of magnitude faster than competitors.
